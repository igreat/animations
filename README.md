# My Animations 🍃😎
Here is where all the code I use to build the animations used in my [Youtube videos](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC16BYekiN_0telZ2z_WgtDQ) or [blog posts](https://igreat.github.io/blog/). Feel free to use anything I make for your own work!

The animations are currently all made using the wonderful [ManimCE library](https://github.com/ManimCommunity/manim) ❤️
