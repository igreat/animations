# TODO: complete the manifold hypothesis scene here
#       1. show examples of real world datasets like tabular data
#          and handwritten digit pictures as a 28 by 28 grid
#
#       2. do some kind of visualization showing how mnist
#          is separated in some n dimentional space, but use
#          dimentionality reduction like PCA to bring it 3D
#          for visualization purposes
